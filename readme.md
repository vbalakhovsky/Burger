* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. On the right side the bugers, which have been devoured are displayed

### The app uses handlebars, express and mysql models
